          <h4>September 2014</h4>
            <p>Completed a one-week placement assisting a P.E teacher at Kirkliston and Queensferry Primary Schools. I developed my Communicational skills as I was required to talk to younger people and also cooperate with the main teacher. I found this experience very eye opening and has helped me expand my horizon to different jobs.</p>

            <p>Began volunteering at Heart Of Midlothian Community, I started helping out on match days with 'HalfTime hero's'. I helped coach the children before half time and also helped to get the children onto to the pitch and help them make the most out of their 15 minutes on the park.

          <h4>October 2014</h4>
            <p>I Helped over the October holiday at the October camp at Tynecastle, this involved setting up before hand, getting the kids warmed up and creating a fun and enjoyable session that they would be able to do. This was a fantastic experience for me and has allowed me to become a more valuable member of the group.

          <h4>August 2015 - August 2017 </h4>
            <p>For 3 weeks of the summer holiday I helped out at the summer camps also based at Tynecastle. This involved 2 weeks of 10-12:30 sessions and one week of 10-3 sessions. I loved participating in the summer camp as it let me enjoy Scottish summer in a fashion in which I liked, playing football.</p>

            <p>DPS 4’s Festivals, 16 teams from in and around Edinburgh partaking in 4 vs 4 games against each other. This event was a friendly atmosphere with all the teams getting on with each other.   </p>

          <h4>October 2015/2016</h4>
            <p>For 1 week every october i  led the Tynie Kickers group. This involved 4-6-year old’s having fun with football through small and exciting games to get them involved in football and enjoy it through games.  </p>

            <p>DPS Football Festival, This was a festival of 12 different teams from around Edinburgh all meeting at heriot watt and competing in a festivals 4’s competition. The main message being the competition was to let the children play without the interference of parent telling them what to do.  </p>

          <h4>October 2014- September 2017</h4>
            <p>I was coaching every Sunday from 9-10:30 at Ricarton(Hearts Youth Academy). The Sunday tyynie kickers group was one I enjoyed the most as I established a close bond with players and parents through my energetic coaching style. Watching players come in on a Sunday for a trial session being shy and not wanting to join in then a year later being confident young children moving up a group really gives you some pride in what you do, and that’s one of the main reasons I enjoyed the Sundays. </p>

          <h4>February 2016/2017</h4>
            <p>For 2 weeks I helped and led the tynie kickers group during the February holidays. These two weeks offered me a chance to try new sessions and experiment with different methods. Overall I loved the two weeks of the camps and I feel they helped me develop as a coach. </p>

          <h4>September 2014</h4>
            <p>I participated in the expedition for Duke Of Edinburgh Bronze which entailed a two day walk with a one night camp. This experience allowed me to enjoy the nature that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to if I hadn't taken part. Also it was good to have a little bit of freedom away from home. </p>

          <h4>August 2015</h4>
            <p>Duke Of Edinburgh Silver expedition was held. This was a more challenging experience than Bronze however the main elements were the same. This time I was required to sleep two nights and walk for three days. Duke of Edinburgh Silver was a very exciting experience as it rained for most of the time but we still managed to enjoy ourselves. </p>
